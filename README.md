# Bamzon
welcome to my version of amazon BAMZON !!!!
a node application where you can pretend buy products with pretend money.

to use bamazon you must first be able to run node.js on you machine.
then type in node bamazon.js into your terminal and hit enter to use the bamazon databse.

ypu will then get a propmt if you wanna buy or exit the app.
if you decide to buy you will then get a list of the fake invitory.
simply type in the item id and how many of that item you would like to buy.
if the item quatity is more than what our fake invitory has. it will tell that we dont have enough, but if you input the a sensible amount then it will tell you thank you for your puchase. on an item that you will never get because, well its fake.
 then it will subtract the amount that pretended to purchase form the bamazon data base.
